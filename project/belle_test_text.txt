Little town, it's a quiet village;Every day, like the one before;Little town, full of little people;Waking up to say...;
There goes the baker with his tray like always;The same old bread and rolls to sell;Ev'ry morning just the same;Since the morning that we came;To this poor provincial town...
Morning monsieur!
The bookshop! I just finished the most wonderful story, about;a beanstalk and an ogre and...
There must be more than this provincial life!;
Good morning.  I've come to return the book I borrowed.
Oh, I couldn't put it down!  Have you got anything new?
That's all right.  I'll borrow...;this one.
Well it's my favorite!   Far off places, daring;swordfights, magic spells,  a prince in disguise!
But sir!
Well thank you.  Thank you very much!
Oh! Isn't this amazing!;It's my favorite part because, you'll see!;Here's where she meets Prince Charming;But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!;
There must be more than this provincial life!
Bonjour Gaston.   Gaston,;may I have my book, please?
Well, some people use their imaginations.
Gaston, you are positively primeval.
Maybe some other time.
Please, Gaston. I can't.  I have to get home and help my;father.
Don't you talk about my father that way!
My father's not crazy!  He's a genius!
Papa?
Are you all right, Papa?
You always say that.
Yes, you will.  And you'll win first prize at the fair tomorrow
...and become a world famous inventor!
I always have.
I got a new book.  Papa, do you think I'm odd?
Oh, I don't know.  It's just I'm not sure I fit in here.;There's no one I can really talk to.
He's handsome all right, and rude and conceited and...Oh Papa,;he's not for me!
It works!
You did it!  You really did it!
Good bye, Papa! Good luck!
Gaston, what a pleasant...surprise.
What do you know about my dreams, Gaston?
Dogs?
Imagine that.
Let me think.
Gaston, I'm speechless.  I really;don't know what to say.
I'm very sorry, Gaston, but I just;don't deserve you. ;"Here Comes the Bride."  GASTON's boots are;thrown out of the door  and the door is slammed shut.;LEFOU,;who is directing the band, looks down and sees GASTON's legs sticking out of;the;mud, and a PIERRE's head sticking up.  LEFOU cuts off the band, and GASTON's;head pops up, with the pig on top of him.  He tilts his head, and the pig;slides;down his back.)
Is he gone? Can you imagine, he asked me to;marry him.  Me, the wife of that;boorish, brainless...;Madame Gaston, can't you just see it;Madame Gaston, his little wife;Not me, no sir, I guarantee it;I want much more than this provincial life...;I want adventure in the great wide somewhere;I want it more than I can tell;And for once it might be grand;To have someone understand;I want so much more than they've got planned;
Phillipe!  What are you doing here?   Where's Papa? Where is he,;Phillipe?  What happened? Oh, we have to find him, you have to;take me to him!;
What is this place?;
Phillipe, please, steady.   Papa.;
Hello?  Is anyone here?  Hello? Papa?  Papa, are you here?;
Papa?;
Papa?  Papa?  Hello? Is someone here?  Wait!  I'm looking for my father!;  That's funny, I'm sure there was someone...;I-I-Is there anyone here?;
Oh, Papa!
Oh, your hands are like ice.  We have to get you out of here.
Who's done this to you?
I won't leave you!;
Who's there? Who are you?
I've come for my father.  Please let him out!  Can't you see he's;sick?
But he could die.  Please, I'll do anything!
Oh, there must be some way I can...wait!  Take me, instead!
If I did, would you let him go?
Come  into the light.;
You have my word.
Wait!
Wait!;
You didn't even let me say good bye. I'll never see him again. I;didn't get to say good-bye.
My room?  But I thought--
No.
What's in the West Wing?
Who is it?
;But you...ah...but...I--;
This is impossible--
Thank you.
But I've lost my father, my dreams, everything.
That's very kind of you, but I'm not going to dinner.
I'm not hungry.
No!;
No, thank you.
Yes I can!
I don't want to get to know him.;I don't want to have anything to do with him!
I am a little hungry.
Bravo!  That was wonderful!
Oh, I couldn't possibly go to bed now.  It's my first time in;an enchanted castle.
I, um, figured it out for myself.  I'd like to look;around, if that's all right.
;Perhaps you could take me.  I'm sure you know everything there;is to know about the castle.
What's up there?
Oh, so that's the West Wing.
I wonder what he's hiding up there.
Then it wouldn't be forbidden.;
Maybe later.
You have a library?
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean any harm.
Please, stop! No!
Promise or no promise, I can't stay here another minute!
Here now. Oh, don't do that.  Just...hold still.;
If you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much.
Well if you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away!
Well you should learn to control your temper!     Now, hold still. This may;sting a little.    By the way,;thank you, for saving my life.;
Can I open them?
Now can I open them?
I can't believe it. I've never seen so many books in all my life!
It's wonderful.
There's something sweet;And almost kind;But he was mean;And he was coarse and unrefined.;But now he's dear;And so unsure,;I wonder why I didn't see it there before.;
New, and a bit alarming;Who'd have ever thought that this could be?;True, that he's no Prince Charming;But there's something in him that I simply didn't see.;
Yes.
If only I could see my father again,;just for a moment.  I miss him so much.
I'd like to see my father, please.;
Papa.  Oh, no.  He's sick, he may be dying. And he's all alone.;
What did you say?
You mean...I'm free?
Oh, thank you.   Hold on, Papa.  I'm on my way.;
Thank you for understanding how much he needs me.;
It's all right, Papa. I'm home.
I missed you so much.
I didn't escape, Papa.  He let me go.
But he's different, now.  He's changed somehow.;
Oh, a stowaway.
Oh, Chip.  Of course I do.  It's just that--;
May I help you?;D
My father?;D
My father's not crazy.
No, I won't let you.;
No, you can't do this!
You know he's not crazy, Gaston.
If what?
What?
Never!
My;father's not crazy and I can prove it!   Show me the;beast!
Oh, no.  He'd never hurt anyone.;Please,;I know he looks vicious, but he's really kind and gentle.  He's;my;friend.
He's no monster, Gaston. You are!
No!
No, I won't let you do this.
Let us out!
I have to warn the beast. This is all my fault.  Oh, Papa.  What;are we going to do?
No!
Gaston, don't!;
Let's go, Phillipe!
Beast!
Of course I came back.  I couldn't let them...Oh this is all my;fault.  If only I'd gotten here sooner.
Don't talk like that.  You'll be all right.  We're together now.;Everything's going to be fine.  You'll see.
No, no! Please!  Please! Please don't leave me!  I love;you!;
It is you!;
