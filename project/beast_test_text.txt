There's a stranger here.
Who are you!  What are you doing here?
You are not welcome here!
What are you staring at?
;So, you've come to stare at the beast, have you?
I'll give you a place to stay!  ;
What are you doing here?
The master of this castle.
Then he shouldn't have trespassed here.
There's nothing you can do.  He's my prisoner.
You! You would take his place?
Yes, but you must promise to stay here forever.;
Done!;
She's no longer your concern.   Take him to the village.;
What!
I'll show you to your room.
You wanna, you wanna stay in the tower?
Then follow me.;
Hmm?  Oh.    I...um...hope you like it here.    The;castle is your home now, so you can go anywhere you wish, except;the West Wing.
It's forbidden!;
Now, if there's anything you need, my servants will;attend you.
You...will join me for dinner.  That's not a;request!;
What's taking so long? I told her to come down.  Why isn't she;here yet?!?
Of course I have.  I'm not a fool.
It's no use.  She's so beautiful, and I'm so...well, look at me!;
I don't know how.
Well, where is she?
WHAT!!!!!!!;
I thought I told you to come down to dinner!
You'll come out or I'll...I'll break down the door!
But she is being so...difficult!
Will you come down to dinner?
It would give me great;pleasure if you would join me for dinner.
...please.
You can't stay in there forever!
Fine!  Then go ahead and STARVE!!!!  If she doesn't;eat with me, then she doesn't eat at all!;
I ask nicely, but she refuses.  What a...what does she want me to;do--beg?   Show me the girl.;
I'm just fooling;myself. She'll never see me as anything...but a monster.   It's hopeless.;/Fade in to;ext of BELLE's room. Door creaks open.  BELLE silently emerges.  We see her;feet;go by as three bright spots shine through a curtain at floor level.  Behind it;are LUMIERE and FEATHERDUSTER.)
Why did you come here?
I warned you never to come here!
Do you realize what you could have done?
Get out!!!! GET OUT!!!!;
That hurts!
Well if you hadn't run away, this wouldn't have happened!
Well you shouldn't have been in the West Wing!
You're welcome.;D
I've never felt this way about anyone.   I want;to do something for her.  But what?
Belle, there's something I want to show you.   But first, you have to close your eyes.  It's a surprise.;
No, no.  Not yet.  Wait here.;
All right.  Now.;
You--you like it?
Then it's yours.
Oh, thank you so much.;
She glanced this way;I thought I saw;And when we touched;She didn't shudder at my paw;No it can't be;I'll just ignore;But then she's never looked at me that way before.;
I'm not sure I can do this.
Bold. Daring.
Yes, I -- I con--No, I can't.
More than anything.
Stupid.
Belle? Are you happy here with me?
What is it?
There is a way.;
This mirror will show you anything, anything you wish to see.
Then...then you must go to him.
I release you.  You are no longer my prisoner.
Yes.
Take it with you, so you'll always have a way to look back, and;remember me.
I let her go.
I had to.
Because, I love her.;
Leave me in peace.
It doesn't matter now.  Just let them come.
Belle.
Get out!;
Belle!;
Belle? You came back!;
You came back.
Maybe it's better this way.
At least I got to see you one... last...time.;
