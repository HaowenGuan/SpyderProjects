Oh, good. You’re back.
As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.
Do you want to say it?
Sarcasm?
Okay. That was tricky, ’cause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.
No. It’s true. It means that we care so much about each other, there’s enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.
After much deliberation, we’ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don’t shed fur, they don’t make noise.
Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that’s also why I chose you as a roommate.
Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.
That was a lot of puppies.
Oh, I don’t know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?
I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How’d you like to come home with us? You’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house.
Or if they accept Daddy’s application to live on Mars.
Oh, there’s this company that’s attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.
Would you have approved?
Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn’t that right, Giuseppe?
I can’t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.
I was playing Got Your Nose. That’s how you get children to like you.
Ugh, this again. Amy, I’ve already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don’t need another one.
So you’re saying you wouldn’t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?
Huh, that’s exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.
First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.
Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?
What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?
Yep, you’re mad.
I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint.
Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?
But I made a video.
I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I’d like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I’m exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can’t take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don’t trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?
Yes. Open it and check.
But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars.
Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.
Why? I really don’t understand what’s happening here.
Amy. Oh, why didn’t I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.
Do you want me to withdraw my application?
And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I’ve seen people make the long-distance thing work.
Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?
I am. Yeah, if I’m going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don’t we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?
Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?
You just can’t keep it in your space pants, can you?
They would, wouldn’t they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?
Good idea. And since you’ve had such a rough day, I’m gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard’s face.
I know. Let’s go see the new Spider-Man movie.
I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It’s called reading the room, Amy.
Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.
I know.
Thanks for coming with me.
I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.
Well, until they invent nose condoms, I’m not finding out.
Oh, yes, you’re the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?
That was awkward, right?
Is it because she’s dating you but was out with that other fellow?
Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.
Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I’ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don’t have all the ingredients to make chai tea.
No, I do. You’re upset about Emily and you’re Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?
Oh, I’ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That’s close enough. You know, I’m curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?
Can’t happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.
Slick, huh?
Have you had intercourse?
Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure.
An interesting question. Well, good night.
That’s your problem. You can’t be alone.
How many women have you had dates with?
How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?
Sure.
Well, now do you see the problem?
I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it’s my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.
Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didn’t want to. Uh, big fan of the show.
Yes.
Who? Give me their names. I bet it’s Wolowitz.
Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?
Yes, yes, I’d be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak. You know, I don’t need to sit here and take this, Flatow. It is because of bullies like you, every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television.
President Seibert, I don’t know why you’re yelling. You’re the one who made me go on the radio. I was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. Well, if the university needs money so badly, perhaps you should start a swear jar. Whoa, that one’s worth a dollar.
Yeah, well, I’m not just some trained monkey dancing for coins.
Look, you’re gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You’re just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.
But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.
Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville, Wonder Blunderberg, and Kansas City. Because it’s a hub.
Do you have cookies?
Good. I don’t deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?
Why are you here?
Certainly. Although, right now, I’m having a rough time because there’s three people in my room, and it’s starting to feel like a discotheque.
Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.
How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldn’t relate to that?
That just happened to me. Next time you’re stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.
I do see what you’re saying. That helps.
Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?
Oh, great, now, I work the controls, I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch.
You should probably go.
Hello, President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. Oh, no, no, no, no. No need to thank mNo, thank my friend, Wil Wheaton. For your information, I have nine friends, hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah, it’s ten. I’ll count Wolowitz. Hello, friend Leonard.
I’m in a great mood.
Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it.
Really?
So no more interviews?
I can’t believe it.
You robbed me of my greatest achievement.
I’m back down to nine friends. Make it eight, I’m sick of Wolowitz, too.
By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends.
That’s what makes their friendship unlikely,
Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.
That’s it, I’m down to seven friends.
When I thought the element was real, I didn’t want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world.
Don’t you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, I’m back up to eight.
Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy.
I have no idea what she’s talking about, but we’re ganging up on you so I agree.
No, no, of course you have to publish. That’s your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice.
Can you believe this guy?
I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.
Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.
No, no, no, that’s okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn’t that right, Bawwy.
You’re right, That was uncalled for. I take it back.
What’s that animal doing in our apartment?
I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse.
It probably won’t.
Oh, everything is just sex with you isn’t it?
Thank you. Ira, if I may, I’d like to apologize for my behaviour last week.
Now, isn’t there something you’d like to say to me?
I believe I can answer that.
Fine.
You’re telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named…
That’s right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour’s dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldn’t build because Santa wouldn’t bring him enriched uranium.
What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?
Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio.
You know, I don’t just say smart things about science. I also yodel. (Does)
Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. It’s like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real.
Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.
You’re a natural at this, Penny. And as the first beta testers, you two’ll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday.
Why not?
Pay attention, Leonard. That’s why she can’t play on Sunday.
Your turn, Leonard.
Roll the dice, Leonard.
Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?
I’ll just roll for you.
Uh-oh! Industrial accident.
You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina.
It’s also your roll.
Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?
Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny’s forfeit, you have become the world’s first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?
Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.
It’s called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?
All right, I’ll start with an easy one, um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr.
Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her.
Leonard! Stop the car!
I can’t listen to the two of you fight anymore.
Come on, come on, we’re late.
I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we’ll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination.
Go, go, Power Rangers, go!
No, we’re not. We’re standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter.
All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone’s civil, nobody’s fighting. Have a nice evening.
Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look, we’re going to be late for the movies.
Got it.
Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didn’t quit drinkin’ I’d leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, ’cause I’m drunk as hell and you’re still here! Stop yelling! You’re making Sheldon cry! I’ll tell you what’s making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon.
This is a restaurant. It’s lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you’d be familiar with the paradigm.
No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize.
I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here.
I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.
Excuse me, miss. I’d like to order lunch.
I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?
Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else’s sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?
You can’t make a half-sandwich. If it’s not half of a whole sandwich, it’s just a small sandwich.
Of course not. I’ll have my usual.
Aren’t you going to ask me if I want a beverage?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard.
Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.
I don’t follow.
All right, let’s assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong.
Considering the number of transgressions you’ve committed that he’s overlooked, don’t you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?
Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?
Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing.
That’s actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn’t agree with it.
Because, according to him, you’re oversensitive and have a temper.
And she wonders why she’s constantly undertipped.
Oh, good, you’re home. I need you to do me a favour.
Go apologize to Penny.
Right now would be good.
Although, a few minutes ago would have been better.
(Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj.
Don’t flatter yourself. I’m just ignoring you.
I’ve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I’m hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad’s meatloaf, and my dad’s on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.
Really? Where’s your friend Justin going to sleep?
I want that one.
Can I get this comic book, too?
I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.
The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?
And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?
What I’m doing here is trying to determine when I’m going to die.
My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera.
Killed by badger.
It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there’s a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.
Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who’s to say that I don’t share that flawed DNA?
But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left.
60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.
The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality.
By this much.
You don’t get it, Leonard. I’m going to miss so much, the unified field theory,  cold fusion, the dogapus.
A hybrid dog and octopus. Man’s underwater best friend.
I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.
A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.
No, thank you. I’m not eating pizza tonight.
Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight’s selection, brussels sprouts.
It’s a small price to pay.
In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.
Correct.
Essentially, yes.
Flattering, but sadly, no. I’m also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging.
Certainly. I’ve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.
That’s an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster.
(Knock, knock, knock) Ugh. (Knock, knock, knock) U-u-ugh. (Knock, knock, knock) Lenu-u-ugh.
I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I’m nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.
Well, if it’s not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung’s Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.
It’s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!
I haven’t. I’ve been meaning to, but who has the time?
So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?
I do. And yet I’m doomed while you live on.
Oh, Lord, I think it’s about to burst! (Loud sound of farting) On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts.
Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.
(Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.
Thank you. They’re my mother’s.
No, the Flash shirt is because it’s Friday, but it’s nice when things work out. Where’s your heart rate monitor?
What about your pedometer?
Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?
What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?
Why are you doing that?
All right.
I am doing it.
We’ll never know.
Okay.
Yeah, I’ve been reading up on biomechanics. I think you’ll be surprised at my… Wah! Oh!
I think so.
Thank you. (Loud sound of farting)
If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.
Coming! (From the bedroom area, a wheeled device consisting of a base, a tee-shirt on a coat hanger, and a computer monitor with Sheldon’s face, appears). Greetings, friends.
I am a mobile virtual presence device. Recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world. Until such time as I am able to transfer my consciousness, I shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner.
You’re in my spot. This may seem a little odd at first, but over time you’ll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration.
Thank you. That’s what I was going for. Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you’ll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.
You don’t know where I am. My physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location.
No, I’m not.
No, you can’t. Wait. Come back. Halt. Authorized personnel only!
I’m behind you. Please look at me when you’re talking to me.
No, you’re not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed.
At my age, do you know how I’m statistically most likely to die?
An accident.
Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.
You have to help, it’s in the roommate agreement.
Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.
This is delightful.
It’s much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular death.
Because I called shotgun. Remember?
You seem tense. Perhaps this will relax you.
Very well. I don’t understand why you’re not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we’re like Knight Rider.
You mock the sphincter, but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn’t survive. There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. How many can you name?
Perhaps you’d be interested in a different game.
This is a photograph of the 1911 Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta. Using Photoshop, I’ve introduced a few anachronisms. See if you can spot all 24. I’ll give you the first one. Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch. And go.
Bazinga.
I have an override switch.
And I’m safe and sound in bed. Who’s crazy now?
Hello, Professor Hoskins. Nice to see you, Mindy. Konichi-wa Dr. Nakamora. Sorry the Swedes disproved your theory. Leonard, my door.
Be a lamb and open it for me.
You think you have me stymied, don’t you?
Raj, be a lamb and open the door for me.
He’s a lamb. You’re not.
Isn’t this nice? The pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin.
Can you tell me the specials this evening?
Obviously. I don’t even have water yet.
That’s discrimination against the otherwise located. I’m going to have to go over your head. Manager, manager. Oh, Lord, look who it is.
The Great and Powerful Woz.
I must speak to him.
Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?
Thank you. I just want to say I’m a big fan. You’re my fifteenth favourite technological visionary.
It’s still six spots above Steve Jobs. I care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.
One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 Apple Two. Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3, it was a pretty nifty little achievement.
Don’t move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how the buses are running.
I’m coming, Woz, I’m coming. (Trips on stairs.) Ow! Aw.
(Bash) Penny. (Bash) Penny. (Bash) Penny.
I can’t get out of bed. I hurt my ankle.
Sing me Soft Kitty.
Would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?
Closer to the microphone.
No. You have to start over.
Excuse me. Is it at all possible that you’re knitting a pair of pants? Oh, well, no, you’re understandably terrified. But, you know, allow me to explain. 45 days ago, um, I embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory, and my favorite comic book store burned down, and when my room mate got engaged, my girlfriend wanted to move in with me, which was no doubt a ploy just to see my, well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts. Uh, sir, may I use your phone?
Yeah, well, I understand that I’m half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. Now, typically, I wear pyjamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. I’ll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man, now, before you walk away, I know that I may appear deranged, but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask. Bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. My legs are getting cold. Why won’t anybody help me?
Hello, Leonard.
Uh, I’m in Kingman, Arizona, and, uh, I need you to come pick me up.
Leonard, I’m at the police station. I was robbed. They took my phone, my wallet, my iPad, everything.
No, I’m not okay. Uh, I’m wearing borrowed pants, I don’t have I.D., and one of the officers here won’t stop calling me chicken legs.
2530 East Andy Devine Avenue,
Hurry.
Oh, yes, please. A pair of pants. And my toothbrush. Yeah, and my mail. And a really good comeback for chicken legs, because “I know you are, but what am I?” was met with stony silence.
Excuse me, Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?
Well, perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, have, have you tried doing that?
Well, maybe you should. There’s lots of books called Sherlock Holmes, and there’s no books called Officer Hernandez.
Any word on my stolen items?
You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. But I’m sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick.
Leonard. Oh, I’m so happy to see you.
Oh, I’m fine. Why did you come?
I do, but, I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers.
Shotgun.
Where didn’t I go? I went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle.
Oh, I have no idea. I never left the train station.
Why would I? That’s where all the cool trains are.
Or had a single piece of fruit.
At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Indianapolis train station?
Wrong. Hunt’s. Hey, Amy, what do you say? You ready to move on to the mustard round?
I just thought you were bad at the game.
Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?
Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but that’ll work. Please? This’ll be quick. Leonard? As soon as we get home, I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay, she can’t hear. The reason I called you is because I didn’t want Amy to know I couldn’t make it on my own.
Oh, of course it’s no big deal to you. You idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on.
I called Leonard because I failed. And I didn’t want you to think less of me.
Yes.
Can I have one more moment with Leonard?
Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.
I wish I’d never gone on that trip. I feel no better now than when I left.
That I couldn’t do it?
That’s a good point. You know, I’m a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, ’cause I wasn’t in direct sunlight for six weeks.
Indeed. I was the world’s smartest caterpillar. And then after pupating in our nation’s railway system, I’ve burst forth as the world’s smartest butterfly.
Yeah, I feel renewed. I’m ready to deal with any changes that come my way.
Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I can’t take this. I’m out.
Would you like to see pictures from my trip?
Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the Cloud.
Here, day one, uh, this was the seat I was going to sit in but didn’t because there were cracker crumbs on it. As it was first class, I suspect Ritz. This is the train bathroom. This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom.
I know. You know, I almost died in a fire in Des Moines, but I stayed put. FYI, that’s when the Imodium gave out.
Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret.
This is how you’re going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?
A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You’ve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.
If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.
Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose.
It’s still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security. (Storms out)
And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?
All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?
Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin.
Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers.
Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, I’m not gonna lie, feels pretty good.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh, 101! Air’s getting a bit thin up here.
Well, that’s odd. We both washed up when we came in. It’s probably a euphemism for urination.
Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don’t know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside.
Oh, I see why you’re confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you’re forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That’s all about yucky, squishy things.
What if they simply don’t excite me?
She’d see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, it’s this.
Yes.
Had a rough night. I thought I’d go for a walk and clear my head.
It’s after nine o’clock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.
No. I think I’ll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.
Hard as this may be to believe, it’s possible that I’m not boyfriend material.
Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. I’m gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?
I’ll say.
I’m sorry. It’s the alcohol talking. Go on.
Nuts to that. What else you got?
How does that work?
Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it.
It’s appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I’ll be glad to return the favour.
I don’t think there’s anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.
Ooh, a pocket watch.
No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.
Well, she’s very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?
Excuse me. I don’t see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. You’d be lucky to land a fella like me.
(Snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple.
Remarkable. Diamonds, crystallized carbon. Every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. But just because you’ve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.
Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.
What time did you tell Amy to be here?
Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?
Good, good, if you had said something clever, she might’ve gotten suspicious.
Thank you. Amy, I’d like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And I’m proud of you.
I told you.
You’re right, the tiara was too much.
Can’t talk. In the zone.
Can’t listen, zone. Also don’t care.
Really don’t care.
When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?
Ooh, somebody call the burn ward. And back to the zone.
Zone.
Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius.
Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And it’s beautiful. It’s not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop.
Did I? Well, that can’t be right. No one’s ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain…
Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I don’t care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks. 
Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising.
Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although I’m pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line.
Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but don’t worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe I’ve always been.
Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element.
Let’s see, what’s next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery.
And that’s why you’re not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess who’s getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I’ll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.
Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean.
This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and…
No. No, no, no, no.
I’ve made a horrible mistake.
This table, it’s in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?
Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000. 
Yeah, well, they shouldn’t have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn’t know about.
Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.
What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I’m not a genius, I’m a fraud.
Oh, great. Now I’m worse than a fraud. I’m practically a biologist.
There’s nothing happy about it. I’m being given credit that I don’t deserve. 
No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I’ve got to find a way to stop this thing.
You know, frankly, I’d prefer a sex tape.
No.
Stop it. Stop celebrating me.
And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You’re fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn’t the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future.
Oh, no, they found the element. (More applause) No, no, stop it. I don’t need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?
The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.
I know. When will this nightmare end?
You’re not?
That’s the most romantic thing I’ve ever heard.
Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort.
I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise.
She might be contagious. Don’t you think I’m having a rough enough day?
Is it me, or does she not look so good?
She’s sick, I knew it. Bye.
I can’t believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.
You distract me. I’ve been distracted since the moment I met you. 
Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do.
Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?
Why are you up?
Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. In one day, you’ve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve.
Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems.
Glad you asked. As I see it, there’s a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.
I’m currently single.
I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friend’s marriage.
Well, hello to you, too.
I understand we’re no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.
A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags.
Great. See you in about half an hour.
Why not?
Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them.
You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, ’cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.
Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again.
I’m here to return your belongings. That’s what people who’ve broken up do.
On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We’re not friends with benefits.
Wait. Don’t you want to go through it to make sure I haven’t forgotten anything?
You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?
We made one heck of a team, huh?
It’s not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us.
Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom I’m smooshing around like pizza dough.
(Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Hmm. Tables work, too. Good to know.
Hello.
Oh, of course. Wouldn’t want to intrude. This is yours.
Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amy’s nose in it.
Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, there’s a simple solution.
Bring Penny to meet Mandy.
Well, right now, Penny’s imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch.
And we learned that you don’t need an eyeball to do that.
Yes. And that’s coming from me.
In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that’s unlikely.
Hello. I’m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun With Flags. You may notice that I’m holding a remote control. That’s because my cameraperson and co-host, Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, has chosen to end her relationship with me. I’m going to pause here to let that sink in. Okay. If you need to pause a little longer, just click the pause button. But the show must go on. And thankfully, all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand. Anyway, let’s not spend any more time talking about her. We’re here to talk about flags. Tonight’s theme, flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women I have a feeling were responsible.
And then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, I don’t think you understand how being broken up works. Can you believe that? You’d think that the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that it’s not as young as it used to be. And I don’t see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders.
But enough about the Czech Republic. Let’s talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn’t. And yet Romania gets dumped. I’ll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?
I don’t know why you’re so surprised. I watch movies, I see what people do.
Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.
Yeah, there’s Fisherman’s Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. We’re gonna have so much fun.
Is there a problem?
You saw through that one, did you?
She watched it. I’m gonna get that girl back.
She was listening through the door. She wants me.
Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don’t you think if I were wrong, I’d know it?
I’m not crazy. My mother had me tested.
I did.
Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.
Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ.
Excuse me, Wolverine: Origin. Miniseries issue two, page 22. Retractable bone claws. If you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, we’d have far fewer of these embarrassing moments.
Tandoori Palace?
You’re good-naturedly ribbing me, aren’t you?
Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.
I know. As I’m sure you’re aware…
If that’s Morse code, that’s terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you’re seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed.
I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.
Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny’s sex life in front of Leonard and Penny. (Howard indicates that he has got it.) Oh, good! Now I can eat.
Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket.
In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.
Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, I’ve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ’06.
Howard, don’t embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play.
That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.
I can’t take your money.
I’ve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour’s chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.
Thank God.
Fair enough. What stake do you propose?
All right, you have a wager.
I don’t see anything.
One at a time. (Same thing happens again. Eventually they leave the apartment. There is a growling noise.) What was that?
Help me open it.
Fine, if you don’t want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I’ll take possession of your Fantastic Four.
Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?
Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?
If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.
Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It’s really dark down here.
His name isn’t Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.
An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy.
Hang on. Voilà, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I’ll suck nothing. Of course I’m joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.
Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.
Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was, it wasn’t spoken for long.
We haven’t established that I’m wrong once.
He’s a snowy tree cricket, and his name is Jiminy. (They leave) 
Interesting. You’re afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You’re welcome
Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?
I’m Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.
I’m sorry?
No, no. We’re here, let’s settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?
Told you.
No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?
Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential.
Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations.
Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.
Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
Penny, I’d rather not talk about it.
Why would that make me feel better?
Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That’s an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley’s chicken.
A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.
Well, I wish I could.
Of course I’m right What are the odds I’d be wrong twice in one week?
I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.
Hello.
Oh, you’d like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.
Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz.
 Yes.
Hardly.
Have I crossed some sort of line again?
Hmm. Oh, who cares?
Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.
No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was.
Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.
Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures.
I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.
You’re kidding, right? It’s a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.
Wait, excuse me, but it’s much more Christmassy than anything you’ve put on the tree.
December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.
I sense that’s not sincere, although I have no idea why.
No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.
I understand. You dispute Newton’s claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.
Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she’ll talk some sense into you.
If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won’t approve of you as his mate.
If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it’s doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.
Leonard, I’m no expert on meditation, but if you’re trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om.
No trouble at all.
My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain’s water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate.
August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.
You did.
Neither do I, but it’s the social convention.
It’s what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.
My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.
Well, I’m not sure about interesting, but…
Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?
Isn’t she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you.
September 22nd.
She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?
(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?
I made tea.
I didn’t make tea for you. This is my tea.
It’s a conversation starter.
Oh, is it? We’re conversing. Checkmate.
What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.
To comfort you, of course. No, that’s not going to work at all, I’ll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you’re experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.
That’s not the comforting part.
No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you’re feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.
Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.
If it’s any consolation, I’m not happy about it either. Good night.
Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?
You’re very welcome.
I don’t blame you. You were intoxicated.
I blame Penny.
Agreed.
Penny, please, we’re facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids.
Not bad? It’s horrible. I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think it’ll happen to you.
What?
The horror!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no…
The horror!
No, it’s not going to be fine, change is never fine. They say it is, but it’s not.
I never met them. That’s what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell.
You can’t know that. How can you possibly know that?
Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?
You’re tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?
I knew it! PS3, definitely  PS3, who would pick a mountain bike?
I guess I won’t be needing this.
Oh, no, the new ones, they’re here.
I’m checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you?
So? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?
Hello.
Hello.
If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello.
Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?
Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We’ll come back to that one.
Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?
Oh, I’m sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better you’re doing very well so far. Next question, are you fertile?
I’m trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.
If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, pro or con?
Alicia?
Welcome to the building.
Alicia’s non-musical, childless and pro-rug. She’s still on probation, of course, but I like her.
You don’t jog.
True, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you’re out of clean clothes again.
You’re welcome, Penny.
Oh, mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. I’ve been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. “It’s a trap.” You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. “It’s a trap. It’s a trap. It’s a trap.”
Come.
Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.
How does one sort of…
He’s upstairs at Alicia’s.
In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo.
It’s axiomatically atypical. Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious.
Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again. (Rubs out imaginary workings)
Who is it? Oh hello, Penny, it’s open, come in. Sarcasm.
You think I can’t hear them? Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp. That’s Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one.
You know, Penny, there’s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.
I’m just talking about bees. They’re on the discovery channel. What are you talking about?
Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?
Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
Brown rice, not white?
You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?
Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?
Good. See how it’s done, Leonard?
They’re gone, Penny. They can’t hear you.
You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.
May I interject something here?
You got the wrong mustard.
Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.
You set it on DTS, didn’t you?
Oh, great now she’s jumping up and down on the bed.
I’ve been thinking about time travel again.
Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I’d just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.
Yeah, it really takes the pressure off. 
It’s time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that. 
No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, I’m not going to enjoy this party.
At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.
You know what’s interesting about caves, Leonard?
Nothing.
How’s this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you’ve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo.
Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.
Well here’s an interesting turn of events.
A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.
An actual real scientist. (To Leonard) How was that?
I can’t believe he fired me.
In my defence, I prefaced that by saying “with all due respect.”
Morning.
This isn’t breakfast, it’s an experiment. 
I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste.
As do I.
I don’t want my job back. I’ve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I’m going to savour it.
I’m not just fixing my eggs, I’m fixing everyone’s eggs.
Use new eggs. (There is a knock on the door).
Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.
I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.
Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo.
Never mind, you won’t get it right, I’d better come with you.
I’m taking a sabbatical, because I won’t kow-tow to mediocre minds. 
Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah. 
No it doesn’t. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved. 
Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Slow down. Slow down, please slow down.
Look, you’re not leaving yourself enough space between cars.
No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs let’s say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you.
Oh, I’m sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?
Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let’s say, 4,400lb.
Fine. We’re travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let’s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we’ll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and… oh look, they built a new put-put course.
This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives. 
No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes.
Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.
No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you’ll really enjoy this, is, they’re shelved with the vegetables, but they’re technically a fruit. 
Isn’t it?
Oh boy.
Well, there’s some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you’re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine. 
Well then you’ll want some manganese.
That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores. 
Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month’s supply at a time.
Well think about it, it’s a product that doesn’t spoil, and you’re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years.
Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?
Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we’re talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular? (Penny shuts door in his face.) Okay, no warehouse store, but we’re still on for put-put golf, right?
I think it’s her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference. 
It’s an experiment. 
Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they’re ever going to be.
I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights.
It’s a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!
Oh, no, no, no. No, I’ve too much to do.
Shhhhh!
That’s just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh, glow in the dark tampons! Leonard, we’re going to be rich. 
Mommy.
You called my mother?
Thank you.
I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?
I know, but why?
This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone’s mother. 
I went to the market with Penny.
Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she’s going to get very crabby.
Yes, well I’m not a child, I’m a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don’t need someone telling on me to my mother. 
To my room, and no-one’s allowed in. 
I’m not hungry. 
Morning.
It’s my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form. 
What do you want, mom?
Yeah.
What for?
No.
I’m not going to apologise, I didn’t say anything that wasn’t true. 
Why not?
Wouldn’t have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.
Dr Gablehouser.
Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out. 
Okay.
I got my job back.
I’m not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me. 
Thanks, mom. Mom?
Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?
Worst Renaissance Fair ever.
It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine.
Oh-ho! Really? Well here’s another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.
Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said “huzzah!”
Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.
That was not fifteenth century soap, my God those people need to learn you can’t just put “ye olde” in front of anything and expect to get away with it.
You’re wearing modern underwear?
I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.
Don’t be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases.
Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two.
Oh no.
Her research methodology is sloppy, she’s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she’s often mean to me.
You’d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.
You know how I know we’re not in The Matrix?
If we were, the food would be better.
Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person.
Well, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. Yeah, you heard me.
Great news. My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.
You know what this means, don’t you? Break out the Red Bull, it’s time to rock Mario old school.
But it’s Friday. Friday’s always vintage game night. Look, mom included the memory card, we can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia.
Well then, no problem, I have three controllers, the more the merrier.
Oh, well you can’t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.
Well, statistically speaking…
Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can’t be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?
You want me to leave the apartment?
You mean just go someplace else and be… someplace else?
Well, why should I leave, this is my apartment too.
Well alright then.
Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.
I’m a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date.
Alone?
What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre.
No popcorn at the mo… listen to yourself.
I don’t drink coffee.
What do they have?
Pastries such as bearclaws?
I don’t like bearclaws.
Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?
Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.
Everybody has a date. Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach. And what am I doing, I’m just enabling you.
I’m sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue.
Don’t forget the male pattern baldness. When his uncles sit around the dinner table they look like a half carton of eggs. (Exits. Extension cord trails after him. Eventually goes tight a couple of times then falls loose.)
I have to make pee-pee.
I’m sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance Fair.
I don’t care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.
You mean like Spock?
Fascinating.
If you’re having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato, or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology.
It’s not hard. It’s simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.
Penny.
Alright, let’s say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone’s not touching my food?
Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can’t work out with you and Leonard?
I’m just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?
Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.
Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel.
Do you know, it’s amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out.
Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research.
She called me dumbass.
Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard.
No, that response is unacceptable to me.
Smart? I’d have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.
I’m sorry.
You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.
Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard’s really my friend, why doesn’t he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?
Oh now you’re just making stuff up.
Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.
When the two of you reach a natural stopping point I’d like to have a word.
Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.
I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun.
I’m listening, amuse me.
Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
I hope so, it was a snort of derision.
Look on the bright side.
Only nine more months to comic-con.
Captain, I’m getting an unusual reading.
That’s a temporal anomaly. Corn dogs didn’t come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.
Oh, dear. Penny, have you been recording shows on our DVR again?
Answer honestly. This is not a trial. That’ll come later.
Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?
I’m deleting it.
No, that’s the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. I’m going to re-watch it before season three starts.
Well, they can’t cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger.
Dumplings? Don’t you understand what’s going on here?
That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now I’ll never know what happened.
Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I’ll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I’ll rub pudding on my gums. I’m going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.
No. They can’t just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.
Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it’s me, and I don’t want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know? I just. I want this done. No, I am not the person who just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb concerned about y’all cancelling his favourite show. Why do they keep hanging up on me?
I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.
Oh, that’s nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don’t care how they end.
Yeah, but I just told you, I don’t have a problem with closure.
Oh, quite sure. (Amy starts a knocking sequence on the table. After staring at her a moment, Sheldon completes it.) That proves nothing.
I take issue with the word compulsive.
…tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, let’s say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?
By playing tic-tac-toe?
Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since I’m about to win. (She wipes the board clean.) B-But we didn’t finish.
The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.
Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off.
You don’t know what it’s like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.
Yes.
Let’s box it up.
Lucky for you, ’cause I wished you were dead.
Amy, I must say, I was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening.
Well, you’re an excellent neuroscientist, you’re a wonderful girlfriend, and…
Doesn’t matter, does it?
And a complete sucker.
I love you, too.
Hello. Uh, is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the season finale of Alphas? Oh, smashing. Yeah, you already sound nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual relations with myself. Now, down to business. Um, your show ended on a cliffhanger. Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. I see. Well, that all stinks. No wonder you got cancelled. Bye.
Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Hey!
Very mature. You’re lucky I’m out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, you’ll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.
Yes.
Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.
Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He’s still available for parties and events. We should hire him.
Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.
Well, I’m e-mailing him right now.
Of course I do.
It’s happening. Leonard, it’s happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.
And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I’d find a tactful way to do that.
As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can’t solve if you use your noggin.
Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.
Leonard, are you in bed?
Me, too.
I can’t sleep.
Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?
I’m thinking of wearing a tuxedo.
Do you have cufflinks?
Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three o’clock in the morning?
Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof… Ow! Leonard?
I still can’t sleep.
I’m getting worried.
Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o’clock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we’d join him in progress. (Phone rings) It’s him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.
The third floor landing. The poor old guy’s been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It’s really you.
Professor Proton, it’s an honour to meet you.
Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we’re friends.
Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it’s going to ruin my eyes.
I am.
Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show’s for me. Come on. I’ll race ya, Arthur.
Yes. And if there’s time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.
Yeah, that’s great. Did you bring your puppet?
Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It’s nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!
It’s gonna get sucked in. It’s going to get sucked in.
Yes.
Potato clock. Do potato clock.
What, well what’s wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.
Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton’s the best.
Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something. :14:11,446
I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?
Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn’t have any friends growing up.
But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o’clock, you’d come to my house on Channel 68, and we’d do science together. If it hadn’t been for you, well, who knows what would’ve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could’ve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.
Yeah, it’s true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.
I’ll do it.
Oh, yeah.
Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this’ll be the best day ever.
Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.
Want me to sing it again?
There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?
Name it.
Oh, you’re not. You look awful.
Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?
Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.
But they’ll know I’m not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?
So, in a way it’s like I’m your son.
Father.
I’m going to need a larger shirt. This one’s a little tight under the arms.
Yes, of course that’s why it’s tight.
You’re kidding. Shouldn’t the question be why aren’t you?
Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I don’t like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think I feel about theirs?
Said the hangman offering a noose.
Ah, much better.
A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatever’s in those pants swims up them. Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don’t I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!
Keys! Keys! Keys!
(Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?
It’s not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.
I must say, I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone, that’s a hot date.
What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?
Oh, dear Lord. Two years ago, we didn’t even know each other, and now I’m in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?
Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away.
And how do you propose to do that? Uh, hope you’re not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because there’s only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that’s called school.
Well, seems what’s on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock.
Super Mario Bros. theme?
I see what you’re doing. You’re attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it won’t work.
Da-da-da da-da dum, boink, boink.
You know I don’t drink.
I love strawberry Quik. It’s my favourite pink fluid, narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol.
Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!
Oh yummy, yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh.
Bishop to queen four, level two. Check.
I’m fine.
Very well. Can I ask you a question about women?
No, I’m having a relationship problem with Amy. And by the way, that book gave me nightmares.
Look at us, Leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol’ ladies.
Believe it or not, Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy.
It’s awful. This morning, she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day. It, it’s usually only open to children. She got them to make an exception.
They let me blow the whistle, Leonard.
I know. And it gets worse. Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.
No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example, this morning, I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy’s dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. Oh, what has that vixen done to me, Leonard? And how do I make it stop?
I assume we’re talking about you now?
So, that’s how this works? I complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?
Well, no wonder the women are winning.
I’m in hell, Leonard. Don’t stop.
Howard, if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted, you’re just an engineer, but that doesn’t mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else’s Nobel prize acceptance speech.
Is it any wonder he doesn’t have a doctorate?
It’s not cool. It’s a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. How’d you do it?
Fine. Give me a second.
It’s not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.
Well, I don’t care how you did it. I have more important things to think about. Clearly, the cards are marked.
I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh, let me see those cards.
Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of your community college?
This deck is rigged in some fashion.
So you’re saying this is a regulation deck?
Um…
Oh, oh, please, if I don’t know, you don’t know. That’s axiomatic.
(Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?
I think I figured out Wolowitz’s magic trick, and I need you to pick a card.
As you wish. (Cards slide under door) Pick a card, put it back, and prepare to be amazed. (Leonard does not) Did you pick one?
(Sliding card under door) Is this your card?
Drat. Is this your card?
I’ll be right back.
Pick a card, Sheldon. Now look at it, and put it back in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory. My apologies. Now shuffle the cards. Shuffling. Wait here. Processing image, cross-referencing.
I’m reverse engineering Wolowitz’s magic trick.
I’m measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one’s been touched. By the way, if you hope to have children, I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers. Your testicles look a tad warm.
Yes. I’m using their Cray Supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.
Relax, we’re not under attack right now.
And is this my card? Rats! I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer. Where am I going to find Uranium-235 this time of night? Come on, Craigslist.
Oh, I’ve been meaning to tell you, I figured out your magic trick.
Oh, yes. In fact, I improved upon it.
All right. Pick a card.
Bippity-boppity-boo.
The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. Oh! Excuse me, I’m getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry cleaning’s ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da.
I said, ta-da. Show’s over.
That does it. I’m getting uranium.
Hello.
Apparently, you can’t hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother.
Figure out the magic trick yet?
No.
Hang on. This time do it with me, so I can make sure there’s no monkey business.
I hate you.
Hu-u-u-uh…. Hu-u-u-uh!
This is Thai food.
We don’t have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.
Well apparently the news didn’t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.
Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we’re going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let’s call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra.
All right. Let’s go to the comic book store.
Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight, we’ll be going on Thursday, because it’s Anything Can Happen Thursday.
The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?
Fascinating.
To the comic book store. You’re probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.
I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.
Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows.
Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?
Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.
A superb choice.
Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse.
Get her out of here.
Why should I let it go? I saw it first.
A far less impressive feat.
I need it for my Robin collection.
Why would I gamble? It’s mine. Let go.
No, you!
Yes, he won’t let go of my comic book.
Leonard, we need a ruling.
Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests.
So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?
Look at that, that’s a dent. Thank you, Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?
Are you ill?
All right. Then is it fair to say that you’re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?
A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?
Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.
Would you rather I offer my personal insight?
Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books.
My original point.
Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be.
Vintage doesn’t even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It’s the buggy beta version.
Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?
What are you doing?
Isn’t it a little late for coffee?
Well, I’ve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help.
I am asserting, in the event that Batman’s death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.
More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.
Has to be? Has to be? I hope you’re being deliberately provocative.
Yeah, herbal tea for me, please.
Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman’s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d’être.
Au contraire.
I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.
So, I win.
So, I win.
Darn tootin’, I win.
No, no, no, no, don’t wake her. She’ll maul you like a rabid wolverine.
Good evening. I’m your guest lecturer, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I was expecting applause, but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. I agreed to speak to you this evening, because I was told that you’re the best and the brightest of this university’s doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course, that’s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. ‘Cause, you see, there’s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest, my sweet patootie. All right, let’s begin. Show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don’t kid yourselves.
Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj, freeloader.
Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. I may have changed a few lives today.
Tell me what?
Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That’s rather unfair. That’s downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, I’m not familiar with the acronym KMN.
Well, I suppose everyone’s entitled to their own opinion. I think I’ll turn in. I didn’t want to teach those poopy heads, anyway.
It’s a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up.
No.
Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I’ve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?
For instance?
Hmm, no. One slip of the hand, and suddenly I’m sitting in the Engineering Department, building doodads with Wolowitz.
Isn’t that their burden? I’m the one with something interesting to say.
I sense that you’re trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. Would you mind very much jumping to it?
Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.
(Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.
