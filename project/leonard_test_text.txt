I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they’re in the zone.
Admit it, you’re a little turned on.
Why not?
Hey.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, we’re, we’re very happy for you.
Why a turtle?
Well, congratulations. Who would’ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?
Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.
No, I got you something for Valentine’s Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.
Well, ’cause I got it at the dirty store.
In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.
Yeah?
Okay, uh, well, I hope it’s fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it’s kind of creative and artistic.
No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.
You’re making fun of me. Forget it.
Really?
Okay, but it’s a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego.
I thought it’d be a little more, just more.
Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.
Uh, Th, that’s true. How late did we stay up last night?
Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren’t even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.
Yeah. You get the paint, I’ll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.
You mean this weirdly suspicious one?
I don’t get it. There’s actually peanut brittle in… Please go to Mars.
Right there, right there, Oh, God, that’s it.
Because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles.
Well, we did it.
I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.
So, where do we want to hang it?
But it’s an expression of our love.
Seems a shame to throw it away.
God, I love you. I love you so much.
Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.
Hey, how were things on the set?
I don’t know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler’s List is tough to beat.
It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.
Whoa, whoa, hang on. There’s no need to insult her.
I’m her boyfriend.
A little, yeah.
You having second thoughts about acting?
Yeah, but it’s not always that bad.
What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?
Yeah, but there was ample parking.
And you were so good in the TV commercial.
And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.
Come on. How can you be sad when you’re going home with all five-foot-six of this?
Can I get you anything?
With your career?
Like what?
Come on, be serious.
Why? Because I’m a, a smart decision?
So I’m like a bran muffin.
No, it’s exactly what you’re saying. I’m the boring thing you’re choosing because I’m good for you.
Well, it matters a lot. I don’t want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you’re excited about even though it could give you diabetes.
No, no. No, it’s too late. I’m your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.
You know I want to marry you, but you’re only doing this because you got fired and you’re feeling sorry for yourself.
Then what do you need?
Oh. Then I guess I’m in.
Not like, I guess I’m in. Like I guess, I’m in!
So is that it? Are, are we engaged?
All right.
I’m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.
Oh, I know. This might help.
I’ve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?
This would have been so much more romantic if you didn’t have monkey hair on your finger.
Of course you’re not. People love trained monkeys.
Hey, you’re in a good mood.
Well, you’re about to be in an even better one. I didn’t want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I’ve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist.
Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results.
Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.
No, it’s all over.
Well, you’re welcome.
What?
I, I don’t understand. All you’ve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy.
Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don’t even live near each other.
The, the element never existed. I didn’t take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science.
Will you tell him he’s out of his mind.
Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don’t publish it, it’s just a matter of time before someone else does.
Fine, I’ll publish.
Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings.
These things happen all the time, Sheldon.
Come on, don’t give him a hard time.
It’s not a big deal.
Okay, Barry, that’s enough.
I can’t believe they kicked you out. 
Oh, relax, she’s in her crate. She can’t get out.
Thanks.
Well…
He asked me.
As I was saying…
Sheldon.
Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.
We must not be playing it right.
Oh, gee, Sheldon, I don’t think we can play on Sunday.
Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?
There you go, she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport, aAnd I can’t play ’cause I’m going with her, right?
Wait. What are you talking about?
Who is this Justin?
No, you didn’t.
Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?
So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you’re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend”?
Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend’s couch. Yippee.
Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked.
What was your first clue?
I’m not talking to you like you’re an idiot! I’m saying the whole idea is idiotic!
You know what? It is your life. If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. Why don’t you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?
Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?
The two aren’t mutually exclusive!
He’s drowning us out. He doesn’t like fighting.
I heard of ’em. Didn’t know they were a band. Sheldon, she’s gone. You can turn off the blender.
No, we just had a little spat.
I don’t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.
I don’t want to play a game, Sheldon.
An old boyfriend who’s definitely not gay. That’s what a guy likes to hear, definitely.
And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!
What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, I’m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonard, it doesn’t matter if you’re cool or not because I’m Penny and I’m pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you’re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! I’m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!
What?
Calm down, we’ll make the movie.
Hey. We’re, uh, going to the movies.
Hang on. They’re showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldn’t want to come, would you?
Just give us a minute.
So, are we going to talk about last night?
No.
Oh, come on. This is stupid.
No, there’s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid.
No, there isn’t! They’re synonyms!
Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits.
Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it’s okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?
Thank you!
I am not going to fold.
Hey.
Sure.
What?
What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?
Okay, yeah, it’s true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can’t live with is you casually informing me that some guy’s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!
Oh, come on. Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don’t trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?
Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!
Why didn’t you say so?
Well, I can’t read your mind, Penny!
What are you doing? He’s not a lost dog.
The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn’t.
Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!
Hey, Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?
Thank you.
I’m not leaving until you talk to me.
It’s a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he’s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we’re in, but he can’t perceive us.
Yeah, where’s he gonna sleep?
Why should I let it go? Why don’t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep? (Sheldon turns on a loud toy robot) Oh, for God’s sakes. So, you have childhood issues, we all have childhood issues, at some point, you just need to grow up and get past them. (Sheldon turns on another robot)
Always is a long time. Sure. Always.
Oh, come on, he’s just going to play with it twice, and then it’ll end up in his closet with all the other junk.
So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn’t sleep on your couch?
Whatcha doin’ there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?
Yes.
Yes.
A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?
Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What’s KBB?
How’s that?
I don’t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.
You can always get a badger and find out.
That long, huh?
What’s there?
So, you’re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?
Tough break. You want eggs?
What’s a dogapus?
Is somebody working on that?
Wait a minute. You hate dogs.
It came to $28.17. Let’s say six bucks apiece.
Thank you.
Never mind. I got it.
It’s no big deal.
Hmm? How much you got?
How can you walk around with no money?
It’s okay, you can owe me.
Sheldon, six bucks.
No, no, don’t ask.
What the hell? What’s the matter?
There’s no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.
When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?
Have you had your appendix out?
Let’s get you to the hospital.
No.
Funny how things work out, isn’t it?
Good night.
Here’s my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani.
Palak paneer, that’s Penny.
And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets.
Uh, 12 bucks.
Sure.
Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars.
Sheldon, are you gonna join us?
Greetings, whatever the hell you are.
This is ridiculous. I’m coming to talk to you.
You’re in your bedroom.
I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.
Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
I am looking at you.
You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God.
At the hands of your roommate?
That’s how I’m going to make it look.
Fine, but don’t expect my help.
No, it’s not.
I’ll be damned.
Uh-huh.
Refresh my memory. Why didn’t I just put you in the trunk?
Right.
I don’t want to listen to music, Sheldon.
Except in Knight Rider, the car isn’t a yammering sphincter.
I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider.
No.
That’s it. Bye-bye. (Turns off screen.)
Whoa!
I almost died!
I’m still going to go with you.
What about it?
Why? What’s the problem?
No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.
Why are you introducing yourself?
I think it is.
Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it…
Of course you must.
Morning.
Um, let me just have some coffee first, and then I’ll have the strength to tell you how much I won’t be doing that. (Phone rings) Hello?
Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice.
I’d love to. I’m just about to do yoga with Penny.
Oh, my God, are you okay?
Okay. Uh, I’ll, I’ll come get you. What’s the address?
He got all of his stuff stolen.
Okay.
Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring anything?
I’ll be there as soon as I can.
Yeah, he’s fine, he’s just a little rattled.
Feel like driving to Arizona with me?
Oh, right.
All right, fine. Hey, can you think of a reason I shouldn’t invite Amy to come with me?
Come on, you didn’t even try.
Thanks again for coming. Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.
Yeah, time’s gonna fly by.
Sheldon.
So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip. Where’d you go?
How were they?
Hang on. You travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?
I’m sorry, so you never went outside?
I don’t care.
What’s the big deal?
Well, yeah, it’s true. You, you are a god to me.
Just tell her.
Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?
Exactly. Right after they said yeah.
Butterfly could’ve gotten himself home from Arizona.
And you thought they all had a silver lining.
Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.
Sheldon, he’s just practising for his cousin’s birthday party.
Sheldon, he’s just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really don’t think they’re gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie.
Next time, you should open with that.
Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?
How come you’re not doing a mission? You’re just wandering around.
Some people go outside and do that.
You want to talk about it?
You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What’s going on?
Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?
No, I can’t. I’m playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, I’m no expert in women.
That’s not necessary when someone’s trying to help you.
Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.
I don’t know what to tell you. Buy her something.
Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.
Glad I could help.
There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj’ll have your babies, problem solved.
What are you gonna do?
You know, there’s no guarantee even if you have kids that you’re going to like them.
It’s right off the dust jacket of my mom’s last book.
Look, Howard, I’d say there’s a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back.
No, no, what are you doing? He’s both happy and quiet. It’s like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time.
Aw.
It’s really sweet what Howard wants to do for Bernadette.
Well, for starters, you’ve broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?
And besides, I do romantic things for you all the time. Can you even name one romantic thing you’ve done for me?
Sex doesn’t count.
Well, I took you there. All you did was…
It’s fine. And also not true.
That’s beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?
He’ll figure it out when he falls off the roof.
Sheldon, I know you’re in the zone, but do you want some tea? All right, I can’t believe I’m gonna say this, but you haven’t spoken in hours and I’m starting to get worried. Please say something.
Nope, it was better before.
Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?
Yeah, definitely better before.
If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you mean cool, clearly you’ve never seen me play the cello.
Sheldon, that’s incredible.
Good to know.
 You got to stop beating yourself up over this. I mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake.
Oh, people get things they don’t deserve all the time. Look at me with you. 
Buddy, I don’t think you can. I mean, once it’s out there, it’s out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.
You don’t know what a sex tape is, do you?
We’ll be there.
I will not.
Invite them to live with us.
Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.
Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesn’t count.
Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. We’re really proud of you.
Oh, my God, is she okay?
Oh, no.
I have to say, this is the best Top Ramen you’ve ever made.
Stop it, you’re gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident.
Oh, rose petals.
You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the stops.
Oh, wow.
This is great. It, thank you, it’s, so much.
Nothing. I love it.
It’s true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it.
No, no, it’s okay. It’s really thoughtful.
I can’t believe you saved all this stuff.
Come here.
Is that a pregnancy test?
How am I supposed to sleep? I’ve been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn’t speaking to me.
Hey.
Of course not.
What are we gonna do?
Please, tell me how I can fix it.
Okay, that is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.
You can’t be serious. ‘Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you’re gonna do the same with a random guy?
What is happening?
U-u-u-uh!
Well, trust me, I wish it never happened.
Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?
Oh, we didn’t screw around. We just got drunk and made out.
Hi. I’m calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is. Really? Um, okay. Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? ‘Cause we’re just talking hours here.
Call you back. Hey.
I would love that.
If you don’t mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling.
Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
What? Why?
Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry.
Secondly, I can’t think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy.
What, you actually want to meet her?
I’m not being weird. Am I being weird?
Fine, you want to meet her?
How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in this woman.
You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?
Oh, great, there’s Mandy.
That’s not helpful.
Are we done?
I’m gonna ask her if she’d be willing to talk to Penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about.
What?
Hey.
Uh, do you mind if I sit?
So, um, I’ve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat.
You know, what we did, when we were drunk.
No, we just made out.
Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.
Never gets old. No, no, to a girl. Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me, and she’s concerned about us seeing each other at work.
Because I didn’t want there to be any secrets between us.
What else would it be?
No, I don’t think so. Although, Penny did say exactly that.
You know, on some level, I’ve always believed that I don’t deserve a woman like her.
I mean, she’s really beautiful. She could have any guy she wants. Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me.
Too expensive. You’d think I’d be used to women withholding their love. I mean, my mother did. I mean, no matter how hard I tried, she just didn’t have any interest in me.
I wonder if that’s why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby, but the baby had Sheldon’s head on it.
Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?
I’ve been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that I’m pretty sure I know why.
Penny, after all these years, I still feel like maybe I don’t deserve you.
You do?
I don’t even understand why you’re with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?
Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?
Good. Because I’ve loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time.
Yeah? That’s because you’re beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.
Huh? If you think that’s cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?
Yes, please.
What is this?
Wow.
Hey, guys.
What do you mean? It’s new comic book night.
There’s more to life than sex, Raj.
Nothing flamed out. We don’t have to have sex every night, you know.
It’s not a matter of opportunity. We’re getting to know each other. There’s a learning curve.
Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine.
I’m not saying it was bad, I’m just saying it… wasn’t great.
To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I don’t know…
All I know is, it wasn’t the way I dreamed it would be.
Sheldon, dinner’s here.
No, we went somewhere new.
No, look, Mumbai Palace.
Trust me, this will be just fine.
What’s that supposed to mean?
I don’t know
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?
Please don’t be mad.
Nothing bad, just that last night was fine.
Yeah, it’s a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you’ve really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?
Okay?
So, you’ve been through this before?
Okay-dokay.
So much.
Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid.
More wine?
What are we drinking now?
Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?
What?
Schnapps. You’re right, that is fun.
I’m okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I’m gonna rock your world. (Penny vomits in sink) Are you okay? (Vomits in toilet again)
God, I had the most horrible night.
I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.
Hey. What’s going on?
Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?
Right, right. You’re saying you talked to Penny?
Interesting.
Excuse me.
Little bit. (Exits)
Hey. Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?
Is that what you want?
I guess.
It would, wouldn’t it?
Good, good.
Okay-dokay
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la.
When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.
We didn’t have a tree when I was growing up.
Mmm, in my family, holidays weren’t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society.
Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.
Here we go.
Merry Newton-mas, everyone.
No, he doesn’t.
Yeah, you got me. I’m a Leibniz man.
Tomorrow.
Um, tomorrow?
Well, I just, I thought…
You are, it’s just…
I know. And those specials, they change every day.
Okay, sorry.
Um…
Um…
Um…
I drove, Mother. I’m driving now.
Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?
Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?
No, I heard that.
I just don’t understand why he knows more about your life than I do.
Fine, Mom. How are you?
Now I’m less fine.
No. Sheldon, why didn’t you tell me?
You must be very happy.
Not the time, Sheldon.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
All right. He “has” a “girlfriend.”
Oh, glad you’re here, uh, sit down, I’ll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny.
What?
No!
When did this happen?
Mitzy’s dead?
I don’t believe this. Why am I the last to know?
You’re right. I’m-I’m-I’m-I’m sorry, I’m way out of line!
What is it?
I don’t want tea.
Then why are you telling me?
That’s a lousy conversation starter.
What do you want, Sheldon?
I want that too. Why are you here?
Thank you, that’s very comforting.
It’s not?
You’re right, I do feel better.
You’re my surrogate family?
What the hell is going on?
Are you guys drunk?
How come you didn’t tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didn’t tell me you had surgery? How come you didn’t tell me my dog died?
I do.
Once again, I’m driving. I’m right here.
Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?
What the hell, agreed.
Mother, remember when I was complaining that you don’t communicate with me enough?
I’m over it.
Sheldon, it’s not that bad.
So they steamed your dumplings, get over it. New topic, please.
Shh-shh-shh!
No!
Why would you just say something like that?
Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You don’t just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while.
Why are you making it worse?
What?
I’m sorry, that really is how it works.
Raj, help me out here.
Hey, Penny, it’s Leonard. Good news, you can take your head out of the oven.
Stay calm, we don’t know anything about them yet. What are you doing?
The box says kitchen.
Hello.
Hello.
That is so great. Oh, I’m Leonard, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment.
Yeah, it is.
Sheldon…
You’re making her uncomfortable.
Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.
Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbour.
I’m helping.
I think you look fantastic.
Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?
Alicia is an actress, just like you.
Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?
Well, DTS has more low end, so… okay.
It’s a little insulting, don’t you think?
Uh, yeah, I’d love to.
Yeah, I’ll get to it, don’t nag me.
Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner.
You want to watch Battlestar?
What’s wrong?
Oh, I’d watch that.
Okay, well, I’ll take you.
Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.
What are you doing?
I had to, she called me cutie.
Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?
Interesting.
Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover? (Exiting the apartment.)
Then I guess congratulations are in order.
I know, I’m familiar with you.
Yes, I was there.
What?
Well then we’ll avoid Finkleday, we’ll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go. 
Mahalo’s a nice touch. 
Interesting, you should lead with that.
You don’t have buffets in India?
What. (Sees Howard entering with a statuesque blonde) Howard brought a date?
Here comes our new boss, be polite.
Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.
Morning
You’re making eggs for breakfast?
Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.
Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.
You know, I’m sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back.
Okay. I’ll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
And we all thank you.
Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something.
What’s with the fish?
What happened to your scrambled egg research?
So… fish. 
Fish nightlights.
Mum’s the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don’t want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back.
Like luminous fish.
Right… I didn’t….
Thank you for coming on such short notice.
I didn’t know what else to do, he’s lost all focus, every day he’s got a new obsession. (They enter the apartment. Sheldon is weaving on a loom. He is wrapped in a poncho.) This is a particularly disturbing one. 
Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes. 
Really, when was the last time you left the house.
That was three weeks ago.
Where are you going?
Oh. 
I see.
Sheldon? Your mum made dinner.
That is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about Sheldon?
Sounds like a wise man.
A death ray?
No, we’re not, we’re not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that…. are friends.
This is ridiculous. Dammit, Sheldon, snap out of it. You’re a physicist, you belong at the University doing research, not hiding in your room. (Sheldon scuttles away)
Really? That’s impressive.
Hey, how did it go?
Really? What happened?
That narrows it down. 
Please let it go, Sheldon.
You’re nitpicking.
Hi.
So, yeah, good to see you.
It wasn’t awkward. It wasn’t fun. Besides, what’s the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we’re both moving on.
Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear.
Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?
You went out and bought linen?
Borrowed?
You know what, I’m happy that Penny’s moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself.
Of course. Out of respect.
What? I’ve dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle.
Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?
Why not?
What happened to you?
Yes I have, it’s just a matter of actually making a date with someone.
Well, there’s Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so it’s a little geographically undesireable.
Look, I like Leslie, but she’s not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.
How?
Hey, Leslie.
Uh, sure.
Where did you hear that?
Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.
Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.
Really, what changed?
Yeah, I can see how that would… a bunch of people?
Oh, I’m flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?
Sounds fun.
Thank you, that’s very thoughtful.
Terrific.
I kind of have other plans tonight.
Well, the thing is, someone’s coming over.
Sheldon, it’s a date, I have a date coming over.
Why, what’s so unusual about me having a date?
Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce.
You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?
Yes.
Yes.
I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way.
Yeah, it’s from Changs.
No, Changs.
It changed.
A little.
I sure hope so.
Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So… Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me. (Sheldon knocks and enters again.) What now?
Listen, I’m sorry about all of Sheldon’s interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric.
Well, I think tonight was a very good start.
No problem, I’m very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I’ll call you and we’ll arrange another evening.
Sure.
Hello.
Okay, well, goodnight. (Leans in to kiss Leslie.)
Right (goes back inside flat. Closes door.)
Hey, why don’t we all move over there so Leslie can join us.
Don’t make this hard for me.
You’re right, it is simple. (Sits with Leslie.)
If the word is pee-pee, just do it.
Thank you.
Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.
Sheldon, don’t make that noise, it’s disrespectful.
Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy.
Truth, what truth? We’re talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it’s no big deal.
I guess we let them wait until they’re old enough and let them choose their own theory.
Wait, where are you going?
What’s the bright side?
Oh yeah.
Yeah, that’s great, you guys want corn dogs?
Yeah. Uh, maybe we were hacked. You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately.
I don’t know. It’s a fat guy on a Segway. That’s funny everywhere.
You know, if you’re trying to make space on the DVR, why don’t you just get rid of some of the stuff you’ve already watched? Like, um, Alphas.
There is no season three. They cancelled that show.
They did.
Oh, please, don’t do that.
Ah, don’t. If they didn’t want to be yelled at by crazy nerds, they shouldn’t have started a sci-fi channel.
With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca’s. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It’s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?
I thought you grew up on a farm.
So, did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it.
Oh, don’t say cute. That’s the worst.
It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.
You can try, but nobody’s gonna believe you. I just, I don’t understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it.
Well, then, tell your face.
You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let’s just see what else is on.
Well…
Really?
All right, cool. I think you’ll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.
The Harmony One was fine. We didn’t need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand.
Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again.
Those things can still happen.
That’s a big deal.
So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?
The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When you’re happy with those, you press this button.
Nice shot.
You’re kidding. He’s still alive?
He was the host of this great… Hey!
It was pretty cool.
Hire him to do what?
It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn’t I?
Do you remember his old theme song?
You’re kidding.
And he wrote him a cheque.
Yes.
Great.
Well, I can, so shut up.
Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you’re gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.
That’s not ridiculous. Good night.
No.
Okay, good night.
What?
Where is he?
Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should’ve told you about the broken elevator.
Actually, he’s a genius.
Mr. Jeffries, I’m, I’m Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny.
Yes, sir.
We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.
That’s too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.
Then what is it?
I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.
It’s important you know how much you mean to us.
I’ll, I’ll call for help.
You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?
I’m sorry things turned out this way.
Do you think maybe it’s tight because you’re wearing long underwear?
All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?
No, it should be: why are you?
I’m sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you, I’m a little relieved you’re not going.
Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians.
When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this Blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in Russia”?
You must be burning up.
He keeps emergency Purell in the car.
Before I come in, you should know, I have gas. (Holds up gas canister) 
Check it out. It’s the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. But it also has an interesting secondary use. Here. Breathe this in.
Just try it.
You’re a mean one Mr. Grinch.
I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, great.
And I promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you’re gonna get.
So we won’t let it get weird.
What about (inhales gas, in low voice) Cookies!
I’m sorry. I did, I crossed a line. I didn’t mean to!
I don’t know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time.
It was the heat of the moment.
I’m sorry. Just, just give me another chance.
Again, I’m sorry. You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married, I got caught up in a little wedding fever. I take it back.
Okay, at some point, we’ll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don’t we just start doing that now?
No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny.
Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.
Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?
Are you? You left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?
We got you that book last year. Wasn’t everything in there?
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny.
I guess we are. So, what’s going on?
I’m sorry, that must be very difficult for you.
Shame on her.
She’s good.
You mean, like in bed or in the shower?
Well, if you had a physical relationship, I’d say propose during sex. Turns out that’s a real mood killer.
Yeah.
Pretty much.
Hey. Off to work?
Have a nice night.
Penny, just, wait. I’ve been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night.
I noticed you never answered me.
Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?
Is it still weird ’cause I proposed?
I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?
I played that pretty well. (Enters apartment. Amy, dressed as a Vulcan starfleet officer, is examining Sheldon.)
What are you doing?
Morning.
Mm-hmm. Great. Hey, can I ask you something?
Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?
Hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys, I’d be okay with that.
I tried in the seventh grade. I could never get used to them.
Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case.
Th-th-th-that’s okay. I can infer from context.
Sorry! Oop!
Sorry! Pardon me! Oh, I’m so sorry! My fault! Check it out. I just got contacts.
Hey, guys, what do you think? Priya took me clothes shopping.
Thank you.
Yeah, good. New contacts. I should have done this years ago.
Just two. Everyday and dress.
Oh, my god, you’re breaking up with me! Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? That is so cruel.
Oh, okay. So, what’s up?
I know. I usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash.
Um, not great, I guess. But Penny and I are just friends.
No, no-no-no, I’m ready! I gave up the gift of sight for you. If that’s not moving on, what is?
Oh. Okay.
No, no, I’m confident. It’s not like I’m unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. Although, this will be the first time I’ll be the one saying it.
Sure. Oh, god, you smell so good. Of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically, if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?
I’m sorry. I’m, never mind.
Oh, hi.
One of them’s upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.
Yeah.
No?
Yeah.
Yeah, me, too.
Yeah, bitches are the worst.
Uh, Penny, there’s something I have to tell you.
Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um, are you familiar with Darwin’s observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?
No.
All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else.
So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?
Sure, that has birds in it.
I’m sorry, but I’m gonna count that.
Yeah. The doctor didn’t want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.
Oh, yes. Indeed, I did.
She completely understood everything I said. Case closed.
Maybe, but that’s not my problem. She’s not my girlfriend, you are.
Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature’s way?
What?
I am not opening that door, Sheldon.
Yep.
(Not looking) Nope.
No.
Whatcha doin’?
What’s up with the infrared cameras?
Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?
Sheldon, that computer is used for National defence. Hacking into it is a Federal crime.
Okay, I’m leaving before the black helicopters get here.
Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?
Or as you probably call it back home, food.
No, no, I do. It’s just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.
Does that mean you’d relocate here permanently?
h,  I love it. Oh, that’s great!
Small world.
Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked.
Bye.
It is pretty spicy.
Oh, okay, it’s not important. It can wait.
Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.
Move out.
Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a family, La Cañada has some great schools.
Why does it have to be about anything? Can’t a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?
Yes. There, I said it.
And she likes you.
Not really, no.
Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment.
I don’t listen for it, but it’s nice to know everything’s okay with your plumbing. The building’s plumbing.
Well, now hold on, how about this? How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?
No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.
Penny, wait. (Bumps into door) Damned contacts.
Problem?
Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.
Sheldon, we agreed we’d do something different tonight.
Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon.
Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero.
You’re joking.
You’re right. It’s Anything Can Happen Thursday, let’s hit the clubs and meet hot women!
Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.
Oh, absolutely.
Sure. What does he like?
You know this can go on all night, why don’t you just come with us?
Don’t worry, they’re more scared of you than you are of them.
Come on, I’ll help you pick something.
Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She’s looking for some comic books.
I think we’re fine, Stuart.
You mean for someone who’s into comic books?
Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn’t make them weirdos. Stuart’s a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design.
Ah, yeah, that’s Captain Sweatpants. He doesn’t really help the point I’m trying to make.
Problem?
Uh, cut it in half?
I don’t believe it. Stuart’s putting the moves on Penny.
Nobody’s up in anybody’s business, let’s just buy our stuff and go.
Apparently so.
No.
When did you pick up on that?
Sure, why not?
Gee, thanks a lot.
I don’t need any insights. I just want to know why Penny’s more interested in Stuart than me. We’re practically the same guy.
You’re right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet.
Hey, Penny… and Stuart, hey Stuart.
And you guys are going together, great…
Hey, Howard?
Take me to a bar with women.
Yeah.
Why?
Do you…? (Raj checks his underwear) Let’s go.
Should we talk to some of these women?
That’s your system?
How about those two?
What about the ones in the corner?
I think Blinky’s cute.
Wait, so we just go over there?
What else you got?
No.
I thought you were good at this. You’re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.
Well, what happened? We’ve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you’ve had with a woman was when your mom called.
Say what?
Fine. I’ll sit here. You take flight and hunt.
Actually, you can. There’s a whole sport built around it. Falconry.
I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon’s lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus, he looks like a giant insect.
Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?
Oh, Sheldon changed the password. It’s now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces.
Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We’re reading the reviews.
Read this woman’s tweet.
Yeah.
In a word, triumphant.
Really? Triumphant?
I don’t know, I kind of promised Howard.
Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now.
Yeah, it’s weird. Even though he didn’t want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard.
We might be starting to zero in on your problem.
I’m still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y. That’s siffy.
Hello? Oh, my God! Is he okay?
Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. He’s in critical condition.
Have you seen him?
It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.
Or it could be sy-fee.
S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.
Mmm, doesn’t matter. Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box.
No, what’s disgusting is he’s still keeping track.
No, no, no, no.
I didn’t know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.
So, you’re going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?
Not gonna happen.
If you want help, just hire a grad student.
You talk to Howard lately?
Smooth. Hi.
Sheldon, aren’t you going to introduce us?
Ah, congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul. I’m Leonard. This is Raj.
She seems nice.
All I said was she seems nice.
This should be fun.
Oh!
Wait, Alex. Do you want to join us?
Given her what?
What?
Oh, sure. Please join us.
So, Alex, what’s the topic of your dissertation?
Oh, that happens to be Dr. Koothrappali’s field of expertise. You two have a lot to talk about.
No. But compared to your boss, he’s the poster boy for sanity.
Oh, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over.
High-energy lasers.
Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.
Thank you.
Ah, it was all right, I guess. Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon. Caught Raj right in the eye.
No, Raj had to go to the nurse.
Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn’t talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt.
Isn’t that enough? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?
What do you got?
Magnets: What Do They Stick To? If the answer is metal, it’s not exactly groundbreaking.
Where are we going?
I had a great idea. You know how we’re always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you’re doing Fourier analysis, or using the Schrodinger equation?
I was thinking, we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition, and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. You just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam!
Can you say that and not make it sound like I’m a cat who learned how to use the toilet?
Oh, yay for me. What about you guys? I can’t promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this.
I was thinking we could work on this at night, and then maybe in a couple of weeks, we’ll have ourselves an app to sell.
Yeah.
I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.
What?
She’s not going to steal our idea.
We’re gonna write an application…
It’s not boring at all. You see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that…
Satisfied?
That is ridiculous.
Okay, we need to stop for a minute.
Sheldon, you’re not in charge. It’s my idea. I’m in charge.
Well, yes, and you’re listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.
Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.
So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this, and just substitute new values for the coefficients.
What?
It’s not a joke. It’s the real design.
Sheldon, I think this will work. Let’s just try it my way.
Are you done?
We’re not doing names now. Howard?
No.
That’s just Sheldon backwards.
We’re not wasting time with names right now.
No.
No.
Oh Sheldon, stop it.
That’s enough, Sheldon.
Okay, that’s it, you’re fired.
Because you’re impossible to work with.
What are you doing?
But I fired you.
No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever.
I don’t want it better. I want it my way.
What the hell are bus pants?
Look, I’m still happy to drive you to work. Nothing’s changed in that regard. We’re still roommates, we’re still friends.
You know what? Go put on your bus pants.
Hold on. That’s it!
We’re actually scanning equations and getting good results.
Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?
What are you doing?!
No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?
Sheldon! We’re working here!
No, that was completely called for. We need quiet.
Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes.
I’m telling you, the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need. We’ve got a hit.
What’s he doing in your apartment?
Why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question.
We’re not playing. This is real work.
Then I guess we would let him back on the app team, and while we’re doing that, you could take an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig.
Okay, now that you’re back on the team, let’s get you caught up.
Thank you. So as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app.
Thanks.
Well, the G stands for graphics. That’s a hard G, so I’d say gif.
Oh, Sheldon, I’m sure it’s not because they don’t think you’re an elite scientist.
Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.
I was gonna say or, but why bother?
Well, you picked a good one to start. Wil’s had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden.
Yes.
This is exciting.
Psst.
I, I didn’t want to interrupt.
Really?
Hey, great.
Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.
It really is.
You have a new job.
I don’t think you can do both.
Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.
No, no, no. We’re not fighting, we’re just having a conversation.
Give me back that juice.
Well, what if you get it?
From a Kevin Smith movie?
I’m just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?
I’m always excited for you. I’m excited that you found this new job where you’re making decent money.
Wait, twice?
Like, times two twice?
I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I’m still paying off college loans.
Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?
Hang on, if you’re making all this money, where is it?
What does that mean, under your bed?
Wait a minute, you have a guy?
Why would I have a guy? I don’t have any money.
Wil, I’m begging you, just please turn that off.
Great, you’re not only more successful than me, now you’re more mature.
That would be great, thank you.
Yes, it is, Wil.
Hello? What is this?
Are those my sheets?
Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I’m gonna go to sleep.
Yeah, I’m good.
Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?
Thank you.
Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster’s wedding.
Who you bringing?
Yeah, I’m glad.
Sure, what’s up?
I’m sorry, you are our resident cut-up?
